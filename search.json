No mentir, hacer trampa ni plagiar en trabajos acad√©micos o no acad√©micos. Todo trabajo presentado debe ser propio, a menos que se permita expresamente la colaboraci√≥n. Debe citar adecuadamente todas las fuentes utilizadas, incluyendo c√≥digo tomado de recursos en l√≠nea. El material no citado o mal referenciado puede considerarse plagio.\n\n\nUso de Herramientas de Inteligencia Artificial (IA)\nDado que este curso se centra en la inteligencia artificial, el uso de herramientas y recursos de IA est√° permitido y se fomenta. Sin embargo, se debe explicitar cu√°ndo y c√≥mo se usan estas herramientas en las tareas y trabajos relacionados con el curso. Debe especificar qu√© contenidos y/o c√≥digos generados con IA. Se espera total transparencia para mantener la integridad acad√©mica: no revelar el uso de IA puede considerarse una violaci√≥n de las pol√≠ticas del curso.\n\n\nColaboraci√≥n\nSalvo que expresamente se indique trabajo en grupo, todas las tareas deben realizarse de forma individual. Se permite la discusi√≥n general con compa√±eros, pero no compartir respuestas detalladas ni c√≥digo. Para proyectos en equipo, debe colaborar √∫nicamente dentro de su grupo.\n\n\nUso de c√≥digo y recursos online\nPuede consultar y utilizar recursos en l√≠nea. Todo c√≥digo o material tomado de fuentes externas debe ser citado correctamente.\n\n\nEntregas tard√≠as\nDispone de un total de 7 d√≠as de retraso que puede utilizar a gusto a lo largo del semestre en cualquiera de las evaluaciones del curso, excepto la entrega del proyecto final. Los d√≠as de retraso le permiten entregar trabajos y tareas sin penalizaci√≥n. Retrasos superiores a 12 horas, se consideran como un d√≠a completo de retraso. Considere hacer uso de este beneficio en situaciones significativas o imprevistas. Si tiene problemas a largo plazo que afecten tu desempe√±o, se recomienda informar al profesor o jefe de carrera.\n\n\nRecalificaciones\nLas solicitudes de revisi√≥n deben hacerse dentro de la semana posterior a la devoluci√≥n de la calificaci√≥n. Solo se considerar√°n solicitudes fundamentadas en base a la r√∫brica proporcionada. Toda la pregunta ser√° revisada nuevamente, lo que puede implicar aumento o disminuci√≥n de puntos.\n\n\nAsistencia\nLos estudiantes son responsables de asistir a clase; se espera una asistencia regular. Los estudiantes que asistan a m√°s del 70% de las clases ser√°n eximidos de rendir una prueba final al t√©rmino del semestre.",

Provide your review in the form of GitHub issues to your partner team‚Äôs GitHub repo using the issue template provided. The peer review will be graded on the extent to which it comprehensively and constructively addresses the components of the partner team‚Äôs report: the research context and motivation, exploratory data analysis, modeling, interpretations, and conclusions.\n\nPairings\n\nSection 1 - M 1:45PM - 3:00PM\n\n\n\nTeam being reviewed\nReviewer 1\nReviewer 2\n\n\n\n\nchaa_chaa_chaa\nyay_stats\nstat_over_flow\n\n\ndekk\nchaa_chaa_chaa\nyay_stats\n\n\neight\ndekk\nchaa_chaa_chaa\n\n\nhousecats\neight\ndekk\n\n\nkrafthouse\nhousecats\neight\n\n\nrrawr\nkrafthouse\nhousecats\n\n\nstat_over_flow\nrrawr\nkrafthouse\n\n\nyay_stats\nstat_over_flow\nrrawr\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 2 - M 3:30PM - 4:45PM\n\n\n\nTeam being reviewed\nReviewer 1\nReviewer 2\n\n\n\n\na_plus_plus_plus\nwe_r\ntina\n\n\npredictors\na_plus_plus_plus\nwe_r\n\n\nsixers\npredictors\na_plus_plus_plus\n\n\nsoy_nuggets\nsixers\npredictors\n\n\ntina\nsoy_nuggets\nsixers\n\n\nwe_r\ntina\nsoy_nuggets\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 3 - M 5:15PM - 6:30PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeam being reviewed\nReviewer 1\nReviewer 2\n\n\n\n\ndown_to_earth_goats\nthe_three_musketeers\nteam_five\n\n\nginger_and_stats\ndown_to_earth_goats\nthe_three_musketeers\n\n\npineapple_wedge_and_diced_papaya\nginger_and_stats\ndown_to_earth_goats\n\n\nstatchelorettes\npineapple_wedge_and_diced_papaya\nginger_and_stats\n\n\nstatisix\nstatchelorettes\npineapple_wedge_and_diced_papaya\n\n\nstats_squad\nstatisix\nstatchelorettes\n\n\nteam_five\nstats_squad\nstatisix\n\n\nthe_three_musketeers\nteam_five\nstats_squad\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProcess and questions\nSpend ~30 mins to review each team‚Äôs project.\n\nFind your team name on the Reviewer 1 and Reviewer 2 columns.\nFor each of the columns, find the name of the team to review in the Team being reviewed column.

All team members should contribute to the GitHub repository, with regular meaningful commits.\nBefore you finalize your write up, make sure the printing of code chunks is off with the option echo = FALSE.\nYou will submit the PDF of your final report on Gradescope.\nThe PDF you submit must match the files in your GitHub repository exactly. The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report. You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report. The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate. It is not included in the 10-page limit.\nThe written report is worth 40 points, broken down as follows\n\n\n\nTotal\n40 pts\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction/data\n6 pts\n\n\nMethodology\n10 pts\n\n\nResults\n14 pts\n\n\nDiscussion + conclusion\n6 pts\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\n4 pts\n\n\n\nClick here for a PDF of the written report rubric.\n\nIntroduction and data\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won‚Äôt fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you‚Äôre fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model‚Äôs predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you‚Äôll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."
